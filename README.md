# SmokePing Puppet module - CentOS 6 version

This is a clone of the [Puppet module to manage SmokePing](http://tobrunet.ch/2013/02/puppet-module-to-manage-smokeping/) by tobrunet. 

Goal is to add CentOS 6 support, as an ongoing project.

Notes, in no real order:

- Used [GhettoForge smokeping](http://ghettoforge.org/index.php/Main_Page) package.
- Config file is now more hierarchial to make it more readable. 
- TODO: forced install directory to /opt/smokeping. Need to make this configurable.
- TODO: Make less ghetto init script.
- TODO: Fix/implement slave config/implementation
- TODO: Make deployment of targets less confusing. 
- TODO: Fix anything broken.
